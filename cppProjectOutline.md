# Soring - Brief Outline
## Lesson 1
Teach about ```sort()``` method for arrays and vector (STL Containers)
- Sorting in ascending, descending order.
- Telling the syntax of sort() method for different containers and data types.
- Problems : 1. Sort array into ascending order, descending order (reversing the array).
- Problems : 2. Sort array into ascending order, then reverse using reverse() method.
- Problems : 3. Find the number of distinct elements with the help of sort function in an array.

## Lesson 2
Teach sorting for strings
- Meaning of lexographical order and explanation with the help of examples.
- sort() for strings and other STL containers like pairs, vector<vector<int>>, etc.
- Problems : 1. Given an array of strings, sort in lexographical order.
- Problems : 2. Given a list of students and their roll number. Sort on the basis of name, if their name is name sort on the basis of their roll number.
- Problems : 3. Similar to this problem : https://leetcode.com/problems/groups-of-special-equivalent-strings/description/

## Lesson 3
Teach about custom comparator function in ```sort()```
- Teach custom comparator function with the help with the help of example problem - sorting in descending order. When to return true and when to return false in our comparator fucntion.
- Custom comparator for various data types, like we can pass vectors<int>, strings, pair<int,int>, etc in our custom comparator function (with the help of example).
- Problems : 1. Problem similar to : https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/big-sorting/problem (it may seem easy but it is bit tricky for beginners).
- Problems : 2. Given two integer arrays. One array will be containing numerator (num[] -> array) and other array will be containing denominator (den[] -> array). Here ith fraction is num[i]/den[i]. We need to sort the fraction in descending/asceding array. ( Will be teaching how / operation will fail here, and teaching how to use * here and how to use comparator function in correct order).
- Problems : 3. Problem similar to : https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-number/description/

## Lesson 4
Till lesson 3 students will be great command on sorting. Will teach the following content : 
- Use inline function as comparator function (not that much important) and will use problem 1 of lesson 3 to teach.
- Teach them about coordinate compression, how to use this technique. 
- Problems : 1. Merge intervals or similar to this one : https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1619
- Problems : 2. Problem similar to : https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/632/C
- Problems : 3. Problem similar to : https://cses.fi/problemset/task/2183


## With the help of above 4 lessons, we will able to teach sorting at great level, where students easily tackle OA and interview problems.
